Introducing BeeBank - Budgeting App for Busy Bees!
Bee Bank is a mobile app designed to help users manage their finances. It includes several features that make it easy for users to keep track of their expenses, set budgets, and make informed financial decisions.
With Bee Bank, you can easily view your transaction data in a pie chart, making it simple to see where your money is going. The app also allows for mobile check deposits, saving you a trip to the bank.
Transferring money between two accounts is made easy with Bee Bank, and the app provides budgeting tips to help you stay on track. If you do happen to go over your budget, the app will send you alerts to let you know.
Bee Bank also displays how much you've spent compared to how much has been deposited, giving you a clear picture of your financial situation. Categories such as bills, clothes, entertainment, and more allow you to see what your money was spent on and make adjustments as necessary.
My MVP will include all of these features and be built using Spring, Java, and MySQL DB. With Bee Bank, managing your money has never been easier.
